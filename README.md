# C2PA Python library

The [c2pa-python](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-python) repository provides a Python library that can:

- Read and validate C2PA manifest data from media files in supported formats.
- Create and sign manifest data, and attach it to media files in supported formats.

Features:

- Create and sign C2PA manifests using various signing algorithms.
- Verify C2PA manifests and extract metadata.
- Add assertions and ingredients to assets.
- Examples and unit tests to demonstrate usage.

## Prerequisites

This library requires Python version 3.10+.

## Package installation

Install the c2pa-python package from PyPI by running:

```bash
pip install c2pa-python
```

To use the module in Python code, import the module like this:

```python
import c2pa
```

## Examples

See the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-python/tree/main/examples) for some helpful examples:

- `examples/read.py` shows how to read and verify an asset with a C2PA manifest.
- `examples/sign.py` shows how to sign and verify an asset with a C2PA manifest.
- `examples/training.py` demonstrates how to add a "Do Not Train" assertion to an asset and verify it.

## Castlabs Stable fMP4 Hotfix

The dedicated `stable-fmp4-v1` release profile targets
unreleased `c2pa-python==0.31.0+stardustproof.6` and native `0.80.0`, preserving default
OpenSSL crypto without importing the live-video VSI runtime. Release context:
`castlabs-stable-fmp4`. The approved native source is
`75f6df217e9bdd11a82e62b42ae550b7d91e9d04`; its exact Cargo.lock digest is pinned
in the stable schema-2 release lock. See
[the stable release contract and runbook](release/STABLE-FMP4.md) for the exact
approval gate, artifacts, mandatory real-native tests and publication safeguards.
This is release preparation, not completed platform-wheel qualification. The
published `.5` release and its immutable tag/assets remain unchanged.

### ABR ladder signing (`Builder.sign_ladder`)

`Builder.sign_ladder(signer, sources, dests) -> bytes` signs a ladder of
*single-file* fragmented MP4s -- one file per rendition -- into **one**
manifest: one Merkle tree per rendition in the shared `c2pa.hash.bmff.v3`
assertion, the identical manifest embedded in every output. It wraps the
`c2pa_builder_sign_ladder` C API from castlabs/c2pa-rs#9.

That native symbol is **optional**: the binding imports against any stable
library, records whether the symbol is present in `c2pa.c2pa._HAS_SIGN_LADDER`,
and `sign_ladder` raises `C2paError.NotSupported` when it is absent. The
`0.31.0+stardustproof.5` library does not carry it; a release built from a
native source that includes castlabs/c2pa-rs#9 does, including the reviewed `.6`
native pin. The builder is borrowed
by the call and stays usable afterwards; release it with `close()` as usual.

Outputs must not exist yet -- the native writer creates each one and never
overwrites, and a destination that already existed is refused before anything
is written and is never touched. If the native call fails, cleanup removes a
reserved output path only when its file identity still matches the reservation.
Known different-file replacements and paths whose identity cannot be checked are
preserved; links to the same reserved file may still be removed. Identity checks
are not locks: a replacement between check and path-based unlink remains possible.
Cleanup is best effort, and lookup/removal failures are not reported. Keep output
paths stable in a directory you control throughout the call. A Python-side failure
while copying the returned manifest
happens *after* native signing has succeeded, so the signed outputs are then in
place. Do not infer from an exception that no output exists; discard only the
leftovers after confirming they belong to your call, never a pre-existing file,
source, link to a source or someone else's replacement. Sources that already carry a C2PA manifest are
refused.

`tests/test_builder_sign_ladder.py` covers the binding against a stand-in for
the native function on any library, and signs a real two-rendition ladder when
the loaded library has the symbol. Set `C2PA_REQUIRE_SIGN_LADDER=1` in a lane
whose library is supposed to carry it, so its absence or missing `cbor2` fails
instead of skipping. The `.6` installed-wheel lane requires this on both platforms
and every supported Python version.
